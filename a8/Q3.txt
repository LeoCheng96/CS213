For any block size tRead seems to execute faster than sRead but
slower than aRead. While tRead uses threads to run multiple blocks
at once it is still not as fast as aRead because it's runtime scales 
with the number of blocks while aRead has the same runtime regardless 
of block size. This is because tRead uses threads which takes time to 
create. 

Also the system time for tRead to execute 1000 blocks 
took signifigantly longer than the system time for aRead to do the 
same computation. This is because the system has to run multiple 
threads at the same time on top of blocking and unblocking which
slows down the system's preformance.
