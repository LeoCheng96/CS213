For any block size aRead seems to execute faster than sRead. 
Also aRead takes the same amount of time to execute regardless 
of block size. This is because aRead uses asynchronous disk reads
which allows it to read multiple disks at once unlike sRead which
needs to finish reading one disk before starting to read the next.
